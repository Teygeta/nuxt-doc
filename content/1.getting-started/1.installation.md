## Custom components

Some custom components are used in this documentation. You can find them in the `components/content` directory.

Here's an example of `ProsePre` component:
```ts
import { Lucia } from 'lucia'

const adapter = new BetterSQLite3Adapter(db) // your adapter

export const lucia = new Lucia(adapter, {
  sessionCookie: {
    attributes: {
      // set to `true` when using HTTPS
      secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
    }
  }
})

// IMPORTANT!
declare module 'lucia' {
  interface Register {
    Lucia: typeof lucia
  }
}
```
